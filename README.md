- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Elliott-Andrews
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning for Software Development, specialising in starting steps in certain languages.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Java and JavaScript.

I have also had exposure to Lua, MySQL, TypeScript and the use of the Svelte framework whilst assisting with a hobbyist activity on a video game modification called FiveM, working on a server with friends.
